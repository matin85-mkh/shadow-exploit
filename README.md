<h1> Shadow exploit </h1>

<h3> This is a post exploitation tool that I write
 this work in NAS  and don't work over the internet</h3>
<br>
<h2> This is some  shadow exploit features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>scan target networks and port and send result</li>
    <li>that picture from webcam and screenshot from system </li>
    <li>you can open url in target system and joke with the target</li>
    <li>exc bash system command</li>
    <li>upload and download file </li>
    <li>run keylogger on target system </li>
    <li>see target system info + public ip</li>
    <li>find system password hash's</li>
    <li>show a fake box to target to steel target password</li>
    <li>steel wi-fi password that target connected</li>
</ul>

<h4> shadow exploit use flask for the server connection except the
php server. In fact, I use some html, php and more file formats . because they work better.
Like I use a bash file except executed python file cause it work better
( In my opinion).</h4>

<h4>I write the server side (the code that hacker run) in python 
because it is too simple to write that code in python. I use flask
as the server. I use c for the client side (the code that target run) in c because
c is more undetectable than python.</h4>

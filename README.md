<h1> Shadow exploit </h1>

<h3> This is a post exploitation tool that I write
 this work in lan(local area network)  and don't work over the internet
by the way i wil add ngrok service to fix the port forwarding and lan problem</h3>
<br>
<h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
<h3>this tool is not written for hack someone or access to a place that you should not access to that</h3>
<h3>so don't use this tool to hack someone</h3>

<h2> This is some  shadow exploit features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>scan target networks and port and send result</li>
    <li>that picture from webcam and screenshot from system </li>
    <li>exc bash system command</li>
    <li>upload and download file </li>
    <li>run keylogger on target system </li>
    <li>see target system info + public ip</li>
    <li>find system password hash's</li>
    <li>ssh tunnel</li>
    <li>show a fake box to target to steel target password</li>
    <li>steel wi-fi password that target connected</li>
</ul>

<h4> shadow exploit use flask for the server connection except the
php server. In fact, I use some html, php and more file formats . because they work better.
Like I use a bash file except executed python file cause it work better
( In my opinion).</h4>

<h4>this is a basic algorithm about how this tool works</h4>

<h4>I write the server side (the code that hacker run) in python 
because it is too simple to write that code in python. I use flask
as the server. I use python for the client side (the code that target run) in python. you can use  some tools to 
encrypt the file to be  more undetectable.</h4>

<h2>##How the malware works</h2>
<h4> I use a flask server in main code, when you run code there will be some info about the state of the malware.<br>
after that when the target runs the backdoor file the options of tool will display.<br>
After that use can run the tool payloads in the target system.</h4>

<br>
-> how target run the payloads that you entered? <br>
Answer: well I use a flask server and a c.txt file that include commands of the hacker,
In simple explanation when hacker select a payload the main function write the text for the special payload in c.txt file 
and client check that on the server and run the payload of the command.




-> Is it detectable? <br>
Answer: Yes it is. but you can use some crypter on the code. so you can bypass the run time antivirus scan.
(I will write a crypter later)

-> How you can fix the port forwarding problem?<br>
Answer: well you can use ngrok service or add it in the code. If I think it is good I will add it.
